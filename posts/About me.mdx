title: About me
description: "I'm 25 from germany and started my journey in the beginn of february, my decission was made arround 6 months before, in a vacation with my dad. 
Back then i was working in many places, (old age care, drug addicts, disabled people, autism, and at least with high disabled people 
from the intensivstation who needed ventilation and 24h careservice) pretty hard jobs so far. I am a big fan of sports (bouldering, surfing, gym)
are the main ones. I actually thought about moving for switzerland to have new experience, sking and the nature, but then i decided
to see the world first."
